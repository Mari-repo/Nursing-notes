# **Hormones**
#### [[Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone]]
![[Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone#Itemized notes]]

####  [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone]]
	
- [[Luteinizing Hormone]]
	- Secreted by the [[Anterior Pituitary Gland]]
	- required for both the final maturation of preovulatory follicles and luteinization of the ruptured follicle. 
	- Stimulates ovulation 
	- Stimulates formation of [[Corpus Luteum]]. 
	- [[Estrogen]] production declines 
	- [[Progesterone]] secretion continues
	- [[Estrogen]] levels fall a day before [[Ovulation]] and progesterone levels begin to rise.

- [[Prostaglandins]]

# **[[Ovarian cycle]]**
- Refers to the predictable changes in the female's oocytes and ovarian follicles. 
- These events are associated with a developing oocyte within the [[ovaries]]
- There are three phases to the Ovarian cycle
