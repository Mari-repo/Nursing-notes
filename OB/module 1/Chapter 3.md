# Anatomy and Physiology of the Female Reproductive System

# **Hormones**
- [[Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone]]
	- Secreted by hypothalamus
	- Pulsates slowly during [[Follicular phase]]
	- Pulsation increases during [[Luteal phase]]
	- Causes the [[Pituitary gland]] to release [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone|FSH]] and [[Luteinizing Hormone|LH]]
- [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone]]
	- Secreted by the [[Anterior Pituitary Gland]]
	- Release and maturation of the ovarian follicle
	- Highest and most important during the first week of the [[Follicular phase]]
- [[Luteinizing Hormone]]
	- Secreted by the [[Anterior Pituitary Gland]]
	- required for both the final maturation of preovulatory follicles and luteinization of the ruptured follicle. 
	- Stimulates ovulation 
	- Stimulates formation of [[Corpus Luteum]]. 
	- [[Estrogen]] production declines 
	- [[Progesterone]] secretion continues
	- [[Estrogen]] levels fall a day before [[Ovulation]] and progesterone levels begin to rise.
- [[Estrogen]]
- ![[Estrogen#Itemized notes]]
- [[Progesterone]]
	- Secreted by [[Corpus Luteum]]
	- Increases before [[Ovulation]] 
		- Peaks at 5-7 days after ovulation
	- Induces swelling and secretion of endometrium during [[Luteal phase]]
		- Prepares it for potential pregnancy after [[Ovulation]]
	- Reduces uterine contractions
- [[Prostaglandins]]
	- Mediators of the body's inflammatory processes


# **[[Ovarian cycle]]**
- Refers to the predictable changes in the female's oocytes and ovarian follicles. 
- These events are associated with a developing oocyte within the [[ovaries]]
- There are three phases to the Ovarian cycle 

#### [[Follicular phase]]
