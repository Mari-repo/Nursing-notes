# Anatomy and Physiology of the Female Reproductive System

**Hormones**
- [[Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone]]
	- Secreted by hypothalamus
	- Pulsates slowly during [[Follicular phase]]
	- Pulsation increases during [[Luteal phase]]
	- Causes the [[Pituitary gland]] to release [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone|FSH]] and [[Luteinizing Hormone|LH]]
- [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone]]
	- Secreted by the [[Anterior pituitary gland]]
	- Release and maturation of the ovarian follicle
	- Highest and most important during the first week of the [[follicular phase]]
- [[Luteinizing Hormone]]
	- Secreted by the [[anterior pituitary gland]]
	- required for both the final maturation of preovulatory follicles and luteinization of the ruptured follicle. 
	- Stimulates ovulation formation of corpus luteum. As a result, estrogen production declines and progesterone secretion continues. Thus, estrogen levels fall a day before ovulation, and progesterone levels begin to rise.
