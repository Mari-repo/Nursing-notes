The ovarian cycle is a set of predictable changes in the female’s oocytes and ovarian follicles. The series of events are associated with a developing oocyte (ovum or egg) within the ovaries. Whereas males manufacture sperm daily, often into advanced age, females are born with a single lifetime supply of ova that are released from the ovaries gradually throughout the childbearing years. In the female ovary, 600,000 to 1,000,000 oocytes are present at birth and by puberty this number has decreased in half (Park et al., 2022). Typically, a female ovulates one oocyte per month over an approximately 40-year reproductive lifespan. This accounts for the loss of 400 to 500 follicles. By age 50, follicular supply will be nearly zero, and most females will have reached menopause (Park et al., 2022). The ovarian cycle begins when the follicular cells (ovum and surrounding cells) swell and the maturation process starts. The maturing follicle at this stage is called a graafian follicle. The ovary raises many follicles monthly, but usually only one follicle matures to reach ovulation. The ovarian cycle consists of three phases: the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase.
