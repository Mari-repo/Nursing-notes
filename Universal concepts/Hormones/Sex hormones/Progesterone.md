Progesterone is secreted by the corpus luteum, a temporary endocrine gland that is produced after ovulation during the second half of the menstrual cycle. Progesterone levels increase just before ovulation and peak 5 to 7 days after ovulation. During the luteal phase, progesterone induces swelling and increased secretion of the endometrium, which prepares it for the potential of pregnancy after ovulation. This hormone is often called the hormone of pregnancy because of its calming effect (reduces uterine contractions) on the uterus, allowing pregnancy to be maintained.
