- Progesterone is secreted by the corpus luteum, a temporary endocrine gland that is produced after ovulation during the second half of the menstrual cycle. 
- Progesterone levels increase just before ovulation and peak 5 to 7 days after ovulation. 
- During the [[luteal phase]], progesterone induces swelling and increased secretion of the endometrium, which prepares it for the potential of pregnancy after ovulation. 
- This hormone is often called the hormone of pregnancy because of its calming effect (reduces uterine contractions) on the [[uterus]], allowing pregnancy to be maintained.
