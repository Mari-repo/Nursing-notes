LH is produced and secreted by the [[Anterior Pituitary Gland]] and is required for both the final maturation of preovulatory follicles and luteinization of the ruptured follicle. [[Luteinizing Hormone|LH]] stimulates [[ovulation]] and the formation of corpus luteum. As a result, [[estrogen]] production declines and [[progesterone]] secretion continues. Thus, estrogen levels fall a day before ovulation, and progesterone levels begin to rise.
