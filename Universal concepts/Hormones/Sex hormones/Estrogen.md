Estrogen is a steroid [[hormone]] associated with the development of female sexual characteristics. Estrogen is secreted by the [[ovaries]] and is crucial for the development and maturation of the follicle. Estrogen is predominant at the end of the [[Proliferative phase]], directly preceding [[Ovulation]]. After ovulation, estrogen levels drop sharply as [[progesterone]] dominates. In the [[! Endometrial cycle index|endometrial cycle]] , estrogen induces proliferation of the endometrial glands. Estrogen also causes the [[uterus]] to increase in size and weight because of increased glycogen, amino acids, electrolytes, and water. Blood supply is expanded as well.
