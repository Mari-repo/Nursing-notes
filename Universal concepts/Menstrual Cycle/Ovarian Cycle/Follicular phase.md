This phase is so named because it is when the follicles in the ovary grow and form a mature egg. The goal of this phase is to produce an ovum for fertilization. This phase starts on day 1 of the menstrual cycle and continues until ovulation, approximately 10 to 14 days later. Increasing levels of estrogen secreted from the maturing follicular cells and the continued growth of the dominant follicle cell induce proliferation of the endometrium and myometrium. This thickening of the uterine lining supports an implanted ovum if pregnancy occurs. If no egg has been fertilized by male sperm, the top layers of the endometrium sluff off and menstrual bleeding occurs.

Prompted by the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland releases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates the ovary to produce immature follicles. Each follicle houses an immature oocyte or egg. The follicle that is targeted to mature fully will soon rupture and expel a mature oocyte in the process of ovulation. A surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland is responsible for affecting the final development and subsequent rupture of the mature follicle. The follicular phase ends the day before the LH surge occurs (Welt, 2023).
